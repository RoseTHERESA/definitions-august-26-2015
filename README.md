##1. TCP/IP  
TCP = transmission control protocol  
IP = internet protocol  
Together they govern how data is found and transmitted on the web. They also represent two of the several layers that make upt the web. At the internet layer, DNS servers match IP addresses (made up of sets of numbers) with domain names. IP thus governs address and finding websites. Once found, TCP governs how packets of data are transferred to and from websites.
