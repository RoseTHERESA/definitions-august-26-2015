###1. TCP/IP  
#####Transmission Control Protocol  /  Internet Protocol  
Together they govern how data is addressed, found, and transmitted on the web. These two protocols also represent two of the several layers that comprise the web. At the internet layer, DNS servers match IP addresses (made up of sets of numbers) with domain names. IP thus governs address and finding websites. Once found, TCP governs how packets of data are transferred to and from websites.  

###2. XHR  
Ah... the XHR object. This I do not yet grasp. It is the crux of the matter, however, when it comes to AJAX...  

###3. API  
#####Application Programming Interface
APIs allow computers to talk to each other. Via javascript, data and/or methods are exposed to be used by others.  

###4. HTTP  
#####HyperText Transfer Protocol  
HTTP is a specific kind of TCP that governs the request response cycle of communication between clients and servers. This takes place at the Application Level of the web. This protocol requires that all data be transmitted as text or as strings. Data must be "stringified" for transfer and then often parsed at the receiving end.

###5. Protocol  
Very generally, a protocol is the way a certain something should be done. On the web, protocols govern how communications takes place between computers.  

###6. JSON  
#####JavaScript Object Notation  
Created by Douglas Crockford, JSON is a javascript-friendly text-based format used to communicate between clients and servers.

###7. Request  

###8. Response  

###9. Client  

###10. Server  
A machine (either real or virtual) and the software that makes it possible to serve data or information. HTTP servers serve content or files. Other sorts of servers include mail servers and database servers.

###11. AJAX 
#####Asynchronous Javascript And XML  
Makes it possible to GET data from a server without refreshing the page. Being asynchronous, AJAX requests include callbacks. In other words, AJAX methods are all higher order functions.
